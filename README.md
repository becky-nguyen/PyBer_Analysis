# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to look at ride share data between rural, suburban, and urban cities to make recommendations to PyBer to help with business growth. 

## Results
### Total Rides, Drivers, and Fares

![PyBer Summary DataFrame](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100896787/166172700-e46311bf-0b77-4db2-aaef-19198bb90cfb.PNG)

The dataframe above shows off what most people would expect - due to higher numbers in population and activity, urban areas would have more rides and drivers, which would lead to an overall higher total fare. On top of that, urban areas require a different lifestyle where many individuals may not own their own vehicle, requiring them to utilize PyBer more if they aren't able to take public transit. Because of this, total rides requested in urban areas is much higher than rural and suburban areas, leading to a higher demand for drivers. 

### Average Fare per Ride and Driver
When you look at the average fares per rider and driver, you can see that the cost increases as the areas become less populated (suburban and rural averages are much higher than urban areas). This may be due to less drivers in the area and demand, however, it also may be due to the fact that rural areas require longer distance of travel, whereas urban areas tend to have points of interest much closer together. Both of these factors may be the reason for the average fare cost for rural and suburban areas to be much higher. 

### Total Fare by City Type

In this chart, you can truly see the difference between the different city types. Although rural and suburban areas have higher average costs, the urban PyBer rides are bringing in the most fare. This again shows that overall demand and usage is much higher in populated areas. 

## Summary
To help with the disparities and possibly increase business profits, there are several recommendations for PyBer. First, to encourage rural and suburban users to utilize PyBer more, the average fare cost should be reduced to a rate that is closer to the urban areas. This will make it more affordable for users, and increasing demand. Second, PyBer may try to recruit more drivers in the rural and suburban areas. This would reduce wait times for customers, especially since these areas may be taking longer travel. Finally, PyBer could take advantage of the high demand in the urban areas and increase average fare prices to be closer to the suburban/rural fares. This would increase profits and if PyBer does not have much competition, they may be able to take advantage of the situation.
